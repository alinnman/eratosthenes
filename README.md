Instructions for using the Eratosthenes plot program

1. Edit the "Era.ods" file
Open it in Excel, and select a suitable sheet. The sheet "Nov-2023_30" contains a set of observations from the last two days of November 2023. 
Export the data to CSV format. Use the "UTF-8" format for the export. 

2. Run the "Era.py" program
You need a working Python environment. (Available in Windows through Windows Store, and in Linux using standard repositories). 
Execute the program with this command "python era.py". It will produce two PNG image files, one for a flat earth, and one for a spherical earth.
